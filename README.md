# Website Project 1

> A Website Called 'Don't Give Up' Is a Online Social Counseling Platform. Provide Online Counseling Services. For Get Support and Guidance From a Licensed Therapist.

I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
